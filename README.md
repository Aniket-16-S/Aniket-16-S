### 🏆 Featured Projects :
#### 🔍 [Local Semantic Video Search Engine](https://github.com/Aniket-16-S/Semantic_Video_Search)
* **The Problem:** Traditional video search relies on filenames/tags. This engine searches *content* using Natural Language.
* **The Tech:** $SigLIP$ (Vision-Language Model), $FAISS$ Vector DB, Python, SQL.
* **Performance Metric:** Optimized for speed—processed **25 minutes of video in just 21 seconds** on a T4 GPU (Google Colab). 
* **Engineering Highlight:** Built a cross-modal retrieval pipeline that maps text queries to video frame embeddings with high semantic accuracy.

#### 🚀 [Commercial Workflow Automation Suite](https://github.com/Aniket-16-S/Commercial_Workflow_Automation_Suite)
* **Impact:** Fully operational in **2 retail outlets** ("Cake of the Day").
* **Value:** Automated customer notifications and order management via WhatsApp API, significantly reducing manual coordination errors.
* **Tech:** Python, Automation Logic, API Integration.
