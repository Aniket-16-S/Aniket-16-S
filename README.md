### 🏆 High-Impact Projects

#### 🥗 [HealthyBitesAI – Label Padhega India](https://github.com/Aniket-16-S/HealthyBitesAI)
* **Challenge :** Tackling misleading "healthy" marketing claims and decoding complex ingredient lists filled with hidden sugars, harmful additives (E-numbers), and refined flours / oils traps.
* **Solution :** Engineered Food Transparency system using **FastAPI** and **IBM Watsonx.ai**, and implemented LLM-based semantic ingredient analysis.
* **Engineering Milestone :** Designed a modular Service-Oriented Architecture integrating WatsonX AI and Open Food Facts API, enabling real-time product audits with AI-driven consumer protection guardrails.

#### 🔍 [Semantic Video Search Engine](https://github.com/Aniket-16-S/Semantic_Video_Search)
* **Challenge :** Eliminating dependence on cloud-based platforms like Google Photos for semantic video search, where accuracy might be limited and user data is externalized.
* **Solution :** Engineered a cross-modal retrieval pipeline using **SigLIP** and **FAISS** to map natural language queries to high-dimensional frame embeddings. 
* **Engineering Milestone :** Optimized inference to process **100 minutes of video in 21 seconds** on standard T4 cloud GPU. Without GPU, on regular phone CPUs it takes around 1-2 minutes for 5 minutes of video file.

#### 🚀 [Commercial Workflow Automation Suite](https://github.com/Aniket-16-S/Commercial_Workflow_Automation_Suite)
* **The Challenge:** The marketing team manually sent promotional messages on WhatsApp. They wanted automation without purchasing expensive Business APIs or relying on third-party services. Also, they needed customer database management application.
* **Impact:** Designed and Deployed Automation and database management app. It is operational 2 retail outlets ("Cake of the Day, Ratnagiri").
* **Value:** Transformed a manual process into a streamlined, automated system, cutting operational overhead and establishing a sustainable, self-managed marketing infrastructure.
